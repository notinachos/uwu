Hi! 

Nice to meet you, my name is Jake. I'm 22 years old, looking for a vocalist to join my band (which currently only consists of me!). 

Before you read any further, please see if these types of bands interest you! If they are not your style, this post will not be for you! PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE POST AS WELL BEFORE RESPONDING TO ME!

-Bring me the Horizon
-A Day to Remember
-Asking Alexandria
-Shinedown
-Linkin Park
-One Republic
-Falling in Reverse

My sound is a hard rock, but also very melodic and containing a sweet rock n roll sound. Some of the songs get in your face, others are a bit slower and more relaxing. 

I currently fill the position of lead guitarist, and have actually written out an entire album (which as we speak is being produced)...

I have been working with a professional producer in Tulsa OK, who has done an excelling job at taking my demos, and turning them into high quality songs, with multiple-dimensions of sound. The instrumentals of the 12 songs are expected to be done by early December, which I hope to then travel out to OK and record vocals at his studio (which is where you come in!).


Like I have mentioned though, I am reaching the point where vocals need to be done, and that really isn't my speciality. So to be more specific, I'm looking for a vocalist who would not only probably come to be a great friend, but someone who is dedicated to being the frontman of a band, and touring in the near future. I am 100% serious and dedicated to this, and I'm looking for someone who would be on the same page as me. 

I have attached my soundcloud link at the bottom of this post, so you can hear 2 demos that I did and get an idea of my sound. 

Lastly, I'd just like to list a few requirements of what I am looking for in a vocalist/bandmate/friend. Of course, I am sure you have your own requirements of bandmates, so please don't hesitate to ask me. 

-Must be 19-26 years old.
-Must be male (I'm not sexist, no one freak out on me...)
-Must currently have a job. While you will not need to pay for recording costs (since I have that all taken care of) I'd still like somebody who can contribute to future expenses (plane ticket to Tulsa, future tour costs, etc.)
-Has reliable transportation
-No drug/alcohol addictions. Not looking for someone who can't focus or hold themselves up.
-Smart and focused, dedicated.
-Must have decent experience with vocals.

Thanks so much for reading my post. If this is something of interest to you, please actually take time to send a response with some information about you (far too many people send a single sentence that gives me nothing to work with). I'm really excited to hear/talk/and hopefully meet with you in the near future! You can contact me at me by replying to the craigslist email above!

Jake
